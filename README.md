# generator-tsoa-bootstrap [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url] 
> TSOA, Sequelize, and Jasmine project generator

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-tsoa-bootstrap using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-tsoa-bootstrap
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo tsoa-bootstrap
```

## Usage

Once you have the app installed, there's a few things you'll want to do.

### Sequelize Config

First, in `/app/sequelize/config/config.ts`, you'll want to configure your database
settings. The `test` settings are already set up to connect to an in-memory sqlite
database.

See [The Sequelize Docs](http://docs.sequelizejs.com) for more information.

### Generating a Model

You can run `yo tsoa-bootstrap:model` to generate a new model. The model name should
be the singluar name of a resouce. For instance, if you want to have a user model,
you'd name it `user`. This will create 3 files for you:

#### `/sequelize/models/ModelName.ts`

This is where you'll define what you want your model to look like and it's associations.
The model defined in here will automatically be added to the default export in
`/sequelize/models/index` so it can be imported as:

```javascript
import db from './models';

db.YourModel.findById(id);
```

#### `/sequelize/dao/ModelName.ts`

The DAO (Data Access Object) will be a class containing methods for accessing
data from your model. This class will automatically be instantiated and added to
your model with the `DAO` property.

```javascript
import db from './models';

db.YourModel.DAO.createModelWithData(data);
```

#### `/spec/dao/ModelName.spec.ts`

This will be the test file for your DAO. Before every test, a sqlite database will
be created in memory and all migrations will be run. This ensures that you start
with a fresh environment for every test that's as close to production as possible.

### Generating a controller

Controllers are where you define your routes and the logic behind your routes.

You can generate a new controller with:

```bash
yo tsoa-bootstrap:controller
```

See https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa for more information on how to set your
controller up.

### Generating a migration

Migration scripts are used to create and modify your database tables. You create
a new migration with:

```bash
yo tsoa-bootstrap:migration
```

In the `up` method, you will place all methods you want to use to alter your database
in the migration. In the `down` method, you will place all methods to rollback the
migration.

To run the migration (and all pending migrations), run `npm run sequelize:migrate`.

To undo the last migration, run `npm run :sequelize:migrate:undo`.

See [The Sequelize Migration Docs](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/migrations.html)
for more information.

## Building and Running the Server

Build the server using `npm run build`. This will do a few things for you:

* Compile the typescript
* Create a swagger file with `tsoa swagger`
* Create your routes with `tsoa routes`
* Copy all of this over to `dist/`

Once you have your projet built, you can run it using `npm start`. Visiting
`localhost:3000` will load the Swagger UI where you can see your swagger documentation
and manually test your routes.

Running `npm test` will run all of your Jasmine tests in the `spec/` folder.
